# Kroger-Bill-Splitter
A Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script that adds functionality to Kroger's online receipts. This allows you to accurately split the bill between two people, item by item. Different percentages can be assigned to each item. For example if one person eats most of the pancakes, you can have them pay for 75% and the other person pay for 25%.
